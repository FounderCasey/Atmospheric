# Xcode 8 & Swift 3 - OpenWeatherMap
___________________________________
Atmospheric uses Swift 3 and Xcode 8 to get the app up and running. We use the OpenWeatherMap API to collect data for the weather.

# Issues
___________________________________
There seems to be some small issues with displaying the correct icons with the correct weather description. For example; icon ‘10n’ has several sub-descriptions(light rain-moderate rain) so icons are repeated.
